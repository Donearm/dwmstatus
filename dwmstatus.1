.SH NAME
dwmstatus \- simple status bar for dwm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwmstatus
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwmstatus is a simple, small status bar for dwm. Unlike large, complex shell
scripts, this status bar tries to stay clean and concise, has no configuration
file, and must be recompiled to change settings, similar to dwm. 
.P
The default setup has 5 sections (from left to right): network usage, battery
status, computer load, temperature, and time. These are separated by pipes, and
read to the specific files in the #defines at the top of the dwmstatus.c file.
.P
To edit this status bar, you must change the #defines to match where your
system information is located and recompile.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Prints version information to stdout then exits with status 0
.SH USAGE
.TP
Run dwbstatus in a shell and it will put its output into the dwm status bar
area (the right side of the bar by default).
